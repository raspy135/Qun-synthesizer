# Firmware

There are two ways to update firmware.
One is using Flash download tool. This is easier option for most of people, but works only on Windows.
Another option is using esptool.py. It will be a bit more advanced, but it should not be hard.


## Steps to update by using Flash download tool (Windows only)
 
**For Windows user: This video might be helpful to understand. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGn-agl8hng (Japanese) **

1. Download and install CP210X driver. https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
 2. Download Flash download tool https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools
 3. Connect USB cable to ESP32-LyraT's (the base board) "UART" port. Disconnect all MIDI connections. You still need the USB cable for POWER port, it means two cables need to be connected. 
 4. Open Device Manager and check your USB Serial port name. You can locate it under 'Ports (COM & LPT)', and it should read similarly to 'Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge' followed by your port number in brackets.
 5. Download the firmware from here.
 6. Press "Boot" button and "RST" button on the ESP32-LyraT board, keep pressing it, then release "RST" button only, then release "Boot" button. Now it should be firmware uploading mode. (There is no UI feedback or indication)
 7. Run the 'flash_download_tool_x.x.x.exe' file, your version number will be in place of the 'x'.
 8. Select Developer Mode.
 9. Select ESP32 DownloadTool.
 10. Follow the screenshot for the parameters.

 11. Choose the 'â€¦' button to select the firmware file that you downloaded.
 12. 0x230000 is a very important number, it is the starting address of the firmware. Do **NOT** put any other numbers in the field.
 13. Make sure that the checkbox to the left of the firmware file path is ticked and that the whole horizontal row is highlighted green, otherwise whilst you may establish successful sync with the ESP32-LyraT, the firmware will not be flashed.
 14. Be sure to enter your USB Serial port name into the COM field.
 15. Press the 'START' button under the status area to flash the firmware. 
 16. Press "RST" button to reboot the board. You should be able to see firmware version in the booting message.

## Steps to update by using esptool.py (Mac OS X, Linux, or Windows)

**For OS X user: This video might be helpful to understand. https://youtu.be/gtFntynAsYw **

1. Download and install CP210X driver. https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
2. Install [esptool.py](https://github.com/espressif/esptool). You may need to install Python as well. There are several ways to install the software, but the most less confusing way is using Homebrew(https://brew.sh/) for OS X. Open the Terminal app, then put the following command.
```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

(It asks to input your password)

....

$ brew install esptool

...
```

3. Connect USB cable to ESP32-LyraT's (base board's) "UART" port. Disconnect all MIDI connections. You still need the USB cable for POWER port, **it means two cables need to be connected**. 

4. Open Terminal and check your USB Serial port name.  For example, `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART` . For Linux, something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`. For Windows, something like `COM4`. You can confirm the port is available by the following command on Mac OS X:

```
$ ls /dev/cu.*
$ ls /dev/tty.*
```



# Factory presets

Here is the steps to install factory presets.

1. Update the firmware to the latest (2.10 and later).
2. Download qun_factory_preset.bin and install.
3. Boot the device. "Imported" message will be shown.
4. Reinstall the latest firmware (v2.10 and later)

To switch to factory preset banks, in the load1 to 4 mode, press "Rec" on the base board.


# Release history


## v2.31

- Slightly better MIDI latency
- EG behavior change, the curve is closer to analog envelope generator, it's suitable for filter modulation.

## v2.30 (Beta)

- Sound quality improved from 44.1kHz to 48kHz. (Floating point is used for internal calculation). This might cause some behavior changes.
- Send and Return function added. When the mode is ON, signal before Envelope generator from OSC1 can be captured through Right output, and will be returned back to AUX R. Returned signal will be processed as OSC1.
- Fixed some issues with MIDI learning.
- Granular logic was improved, more snappy response, more possibilty to get usable result. It can be used as kind of wavetable synth when you set very short length with one grain.

### v2.20

- A bug fix of Pulth Width mod behavior modulated by freq1/freq2.
- Note on for note zero will be ignored (Keystep Pro sends the message for some reason)

### v2.11

- A bug fix : System crash with precise value adjustment.
- Catch value indicator: Dial value adjustment is disable when you do precise value adjustment by "Rec" and "Mode" button. However, if you turn the dial, "*" character will be indicated when the current value matches the knob value. It can be used as "Catch" mode to prevent value jumping.


### v2.10

- Some changes to configure Duo mode easier. Now MIX and OSC2 Env sel are ignored in Duo mode, those parameters are forcefully set properly for Duo Mode to avoid configuration erros. OSC1 parameters can be copied to OSC2 by long pressing button 7 in Poly/Duo mode configuration.
- MIDI learning will learn CC# and MIDI channel. It means it can learn CC# even the MIDI channel is different.
- 9th and 10th Submode such as FM Conf can be selected by "Rec" or "Mode" buttons on the base board.
- Master pan removed to improve stability
- Sound engine optimizations, including better filter response.
- Keysync (following MIDI note pitch) paramater resumed. Modulation wheel mode was deleted instead.
- Sometimes fine adjustment is hard. Now you can use "Rec" and "Mode" button to change the value by 1. To do this, keep pressing one of 8 buttons and instead of rotating dial, press "Rec" for decrease, "Mode" for increase.
- Pattern shuffle is added to sequencer. You can shuffle sequencer's playing order.

### v2.0 beta

- Looper becomes Multitrack (3 tracks) + Copy & Paste buffer
- Mixer sub-mode is added. Output can be panned (stereo). 
- Looper signal can be routed to AUX L

- Keysync was removed
- Sound engine optimizations

### v1.70

- Wavefolding is added (VCF/button 7), OSC1 Bypass was removed from UI.
- Mode indication becomes icon

### v1.66

- Seq tune : MIDI keyboard input result is more predictable when key is not C.

### v1.65

- Bug fix: Possible system crush when saving / loading tone.

### v1.64

- Second filter is added. It works when 2 pole filter is selected.
- Swing (shuffle) with the sequencer.

### V1.63

- Sending 14-bit MIDI internally for VCF cutoff and OSC tunes for better transition (If you have 14-bit MIDI controller it can be done by external controller as well)

	- Sequencer data save button (In Seq bank menu) was removed. 8 sequencer banks are available.
	- Sequencer data will be saved when preset is saved (Set:Save Bnk1-4).
	- Sequencer data will be loaded when preset is loaded (Set:Load Bnk1-4).
	- **By this change, previous saved sequencer data will be erased**.
- Sequencer count can go more than 8. When it's set more than 8, next bank will be played. (If you set it as 16 in Bank 1, then bank 1 and bank 2 will be connected)
- Sequencer bank data can be cleared(Initialized) in Seq bank menu. In Seq bank mode, press button + turn dial, it goes to COPY mode. Select "Clear" to clear the bank.
- Sequencer can start / stop from Seq bank sub mode. Play or stop by long-pressing any button of button 1 to 8.
- Sound engine won't be turned off with Granular sub-mode.
- Fixed some issues with touch buttons
- Fixed the dial linearity issue
- Fixed : 4 pole non-linear issue
